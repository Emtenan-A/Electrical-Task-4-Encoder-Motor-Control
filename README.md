# Electrical-Task-4-Encoder-Motor-Control

## The Forth Task of the Electrical Department is to make an Encoder Motor Control Circuit.

In this task, a circuit for an encoder motor was designed in TinkerCAD. The encoder motor counts the number of revolutions made by the motor. In our project, the encoder will be combined with a brushlessÂ motor in the robot.
